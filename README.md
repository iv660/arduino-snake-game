Classic snake game for Arduino

## Ideas to Improve the Game
Here are some ideas to improve the classic Snake game:

1. **Add levels**: Introduce different levels with varying grid sizes, obstacle layouts, or apple spawn rates to increase difficulty and challenge.
2. **Power-ups**: Introduce special power-ups, such as:
	* Speed boost: temporarily increases the snake's speed.
	* Shield: protects the snake from collision with its own body or the screen boundary.
	* Score multiplier: increases the points awarded for eating apples.
3. **Obstacles**: Add obstacles like rocks, walls, or other barriers that the snake must navigate around.
4. **Multiple snakes**: Introduce multiple snakes that can be controlled simultaneously, either by the same player or by multiple players.
5. **Time attack**: Add a time limit for each level or a timer that counts down, and challenge the player to eat as many apples as possible within the time limit.
6. **Score targets**: Set specific score targets for each level, and reward the player for achieving them.
7. **Visual and audio enhancements**: Improve the game's visuals and audio, such as:
	* Smooth animations and transitions.
	* Colorful and varied graphics.
	* Sound effects for snake movements, apple consumption, and collisions.
	* A catchy background soundtrack.
8. **Game modes**: Offer different game modes, such as:
	* Classic mode: the original game with standard rules.
	* Endless mode: the game continues indefinitely, with the goal of achieving the highest score.
	* Puzzle mode: the player must navigate the snake through a maze-like level to reach the exit.
9. **High score tracking**: Store and display high scores, either locally or online, to encourage competition and replayability.
10. **Mobile optimization**: If developing for mobile devices, consider optimizing the game for touch controls and smaller screens.
