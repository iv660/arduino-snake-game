Classic snake game for Arduino.

## Ideas to Improve the Game
Here are some ideas to improve the classic Snake game:

* [ ] **Add advanced levels**: Introduce different levels with varying grid sizes, obstacle layouts, or apple spawn rates to increase difficulty and challenge.

* [ ] **Power-ups**: Introduce special power-ups, such as:
	* [ ] Speed boost: temporarily increases the snake's speed.
	* [ ] Shield: protects the snake from collision with its own body or the screen boundary.
	* [ ] Score multiplier: increases the points awarded for eating apples.

* [ ] **Obstacles**: Add obstacles like rocks, walls, or other barriers that the snake must navigate around.

* [ ] **Multiple apples**: Place multiple apples at a time. Require the player to eat all the apples before placing any new ones.

* [ ] **Fake targets**: Place multiple apples, only one of which is actually edible.

* [ ] **Avalanche effect**: Eating each apple brings two new apples.

* [ ] **Invisible apples**: When this challenge is active, each apple appears on the screen for a short amount of time and then disappears. The player must memorize the location of the hidden apple and find it without visual guidance.

* [ ] **Multiple snakes**: Introduce multiple snakes that can be controlled simultaneously, either by the same player or by multiple players.

* [ ] **Time attack**: Add a timer that counts down, and challenge the player to eat an apple before the timer runs out.

* [x] **Time bomb challenge**: Randomly activate bombs with countdown timers. The player must deactivate the time bomb by colliding into it before the timer reaches zero.

* [ ] **Score targets**: Set specific score targets for each level, and reward the player for achieving them.

* [ ] **Hyperspace challenge**: Divide the scene into two spaces. When an apple appears in the other space the snake does, open two wormhole ports to let the snake pass between spaces. When an apple is in the same space as the snake, close the wormhole ports.

* [ ] **Collector challenge**: The player can collect a series of items. Reward player for completing a collection with points and/or extra life.

* [ ] **Life bonus**: Place life bonus (a filled heart icon) on the scene for the player to collect.

* [ ] **Max lives extension bonus**: Place a hollow heart icon to extend maximum lives limit.

* [ ] **Visual and audio enhancements**: Improve the game's visuals and audio, such as:
	* [ ] Smooth animations and transitions.
	* [ ] Colorful and varied graphics.
	* [ ] Sound effects for snake movements, apple consumption, and collisions.
	* [ ] A catchy background soundtrack.

* [ ] **Game modes**: Offer different game modes, such as:
	* [ ] Classic mode: the original game with standard rules.
	* [ ] Endless mode: the game continues indefinitely, with the goal of achieving the highest score.
	* [ ] Puzzle mode: the player must navigate the snake through a maze-like level to reach the exit.

* [x] **High score tracking**: Store and display high scores, either locally or online, to encourage competition and replayability.

* [ ] **Mobile optimization**: If developing for mobile devices, consider optimizing the game for touch controls and smaller screens.
